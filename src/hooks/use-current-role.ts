/**
 * AcademyOS V2 — Role model.
 *
 * The database currently stores `profiles.role` as `"owner" | "coach"`.
 * The V2 UI presents three roles: Owner, Admin, Student.
 *
 * Mapping:
 *   profiles.role === "owner"         → Owner (full access)
 *   profiles.role === "coach"         → Admin (no finances, no subscription, no website settings)
 *   linked via mc_parent_links / no
 *   profile in tenant                 → Student / Parent (read-only, own data)
 *
 * This is a pure UI derivation. Data access is still enforced by RLS
 * (`is_tenant_member`, `is_platform_admin`, `has_role`, etc.).
