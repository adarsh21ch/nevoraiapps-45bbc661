/**
 * Academy OS Design System — the single dashboard UI library.
 *
 * Every dashboard route must compose its UI exclusively from the components
 * exported here. Do NOT hand-roll page-level headers, tabs, search bars,
 * cards, filters, badges, buttons, empty states or list rows in individual
 * routes; use these instead so every module inherits the same typography,
 * spacing, radius, shadow, colour and interaction language.
 *
 * The look is extracted verbatim from the Students module (the golden
 * standard) so the visual identity remains stable across the app.
