/**
 * Shared sub-navigation for the Match Center "Insights" family.

 * Consolidation: Leaderboards / Records / Players / Awards / AI used to be
 * five separate destinations reachable only through a hub page of links.
 * They now share one tab bar so the whole performance surface behaves like a
 * single screen with tabs. Individual routes stay live so deep links,
 * bookmarks and AI tool hrefs keep working.
