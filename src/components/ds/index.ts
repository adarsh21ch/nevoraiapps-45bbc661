/**
 * AcademyOS V2 — Design System barrel.

 * Every new screen should import primitives from here:
 *   import { AppShell, TopBar, BottomNav, Card, StatCard, ... } from "@/components/ds";
 *
 * Rules:
 *  - No hardcoded colors — use CSS tokens from src/styles.css.
 *  - No duplicate components — extend existing primitives.
 *  - Mobile first — every primitive is designed for one-hand thumb use.
